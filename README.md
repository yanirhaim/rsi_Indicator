# Relative Strength Index Calculator
The relative strength index is a technical indicator used in the analysis of financial markets. It is intended to chart the current and historical strength or weakness of a stock or market based on the closing prices of a recent trading period. The indicator should not be confused with relative strength.
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

This are the libraries you'll need to still for using the file
* [Matplotlib](https://problemsolvingwithpython.com/06-Plotting-with-Matplotlib/06.02-Installing%20Matplotlib/) - Library for creating the Graph
* [Numpy](https://problemsolvingwithpython.com/05-NumPy-and-Arrays/05.02-Installing-NumPy/) - Library for numerical computation
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/install.html) - Library for creating DataFrames

Also install from the command line this libraries in case they are not pre-installed

```
pip install requests
pip install json
```
## Running the tests

Once you have intalled the required libraries, you can easily execute the code, and you'll see the dataFrame of values on your terminal, as well as it would pop up the graph of the RSI of the stock.

For changing the stock, you can easily change the ticker value that is used on the variable **ticker**; as well as you can change the value of the period, where its value is stored on the variable **period**.

## How to calculate it ?
In case you want to know how the steps to calculate it, you can just see the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt0KQg52c6c), where it explains every step on how to calculate it.
